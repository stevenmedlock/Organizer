# Proposal

### This organizer will help students complete more work and get better grades. The toughest part of being a student is keeping all of the assignments and their due dates straight. This project will help students and even teachers to become better.

### The organizer will be tailored to each user and will show upcoming due dates.

### The user will be prompted to a login screen, showing a login with facebook button. When logged in, the user will be prompted to the main screen showing a calendar with the "to-do" information. When one clicks on a specific day, the information for that day will pop up.

### The front-end code will be done HTML with CSS. The back-end will be done with Python using PyCharm.
